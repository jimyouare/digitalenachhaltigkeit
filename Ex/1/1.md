* Chapter 3: Justice and human rights 
	
	Focusing on human rights in the digital age is key. Data collection is already happening on an industrial scale. States, political parties, various organizations and, in particular, businesses hold remarkably detailed and powerful information about us. More and more aspects of our lives are being digitally tracked, stored, used – and misused.

* Chapter 4: Gender equality -> equal access to the digital world (end the digital divide)

	Globally, in 2020, 62 per cent of all men were using the Internet, compared with 57 per cent of all women. 
	In all regions, the gender Internet divide has been narrowing in recent years. Thus, the global gender parity score has improved from 0.89 in 2018 to 0.92 in 2020.
	The divide remains wide in the Least Developed Countries, where only 19 per cent of women are using the Internet (12 percentage points lower than men), the landlocked developing countries (27 per cent of women versus 38 per cent of men), Africa (24 per cent versus 35 per cent) and the Arab States (56 per cent versus 68 per cent).
